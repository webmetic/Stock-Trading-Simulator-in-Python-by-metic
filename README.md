I probably won't be updating this code. You can do whatever you'd like with it. Please drop me an email if you use it. It would make me happy :D

You could download stock data for different stocks or update the stocks prices. You would have to convert all the dates into text and prices need to be limited to 2 decimal places.

Download stock data on the excel file using this:
